**Topographic Features.**

Given a raster Digital Terrain Model (dtm); investigate its utility through extracting topographic features:
- slope (gradient and aspect), profile curvature, planform curvature and curvature - with [richdem](https://richdem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html);
- terrain ruggedness, creating a hillshade and generating contours - with [gdal](https://gdal.org/index.html);
- as a bonus interrogate the surface interactively - with [PyVista](https://docs.pyvista.org/).
