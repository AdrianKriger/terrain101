Experiments in the computation and representation of terrain

- hw01: interactive Bowyer-Watson delaunay triangulation with voronoi and circumcircle;
- hw01_a: interpolation techniques (Kd-tree Nearest neighbor, Kd-tree Inverse distance weighting (idw), Delaunay ~ Triangulated Irregular Network (tin) and Kriging (GaussianProcessRegression));
- hw01_b: AHN3 interpolation techniques;
- hw02_a: terrain simplification;
- hw03: ground filtering with dtm and dsm interpolation (idw and tin);
- hw04_a: plane detection (rooves).


Additional:
- ch06: topographic features;  
- ch07: runoff modelling;
- ch08: representation conversions (raster with vector to constrained delaunay (tin));
- gms260S_MA02: Geomatics 2. Major Assignment 2: *Photogrammetric Processing*.
