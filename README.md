Experiments in the computation and representation of terrain

- hw01: interactive Bowyer-Watson delaunay triangulation with voronoi and circumcircle;
- hw01_a: interpolation techniques (Kd-tree Nearest neighbor, Kd-tree Inverse distance weighting (idw), Delaunay ~ Triangulated Irregular Network (tin) and Kriging (GaussianProcessRegression));
- hw01_b: AHN3 interpolation techniques;
- hw02_a: terrain simplification;
- hw03: ground filtering with dtm and dsm interpolation (idw and tin).

Additional:
- ch06: topographic features
